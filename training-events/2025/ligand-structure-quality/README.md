# Searching the PDB for high-quality ligand-bound structures
High-quality ligand-bound structures are indispensable for understanding the interaction between small molecule ligands and their target proteins and nucleic acids. In this webinar, we will illustrate the PDB ligand validation and annotation process, and explain the metrics that measure ligand quality from various perspectives. We will then demonstrate how to use these metrics to search PDB for high-quality ligand-bound structures.
