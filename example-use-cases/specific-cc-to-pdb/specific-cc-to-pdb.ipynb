    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to query the RCSB Search API to generate a mapping between chemical component IDs (ligands) and PDB structures that contain them. By leveraging the `rcsb-api` Python package, it performs exact-match attribute searches and compiles the results into a simple TSV file for downstream analysis or curation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs and Associated Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`ccids`**: A list of chemical component IDs (e.g., `\"ATP\"`, `\"GTP\"`, `\"KYW\"`) representing ligands of interest.\n",
    "* **`AttributeQuery`**: A query class from the `rcsbapi.search` module that enables structured searches against PDB metadata fields.\n",
    "* **`output_file`**: File path (`\"cc-to-pdb.tsv\"`) to store the final ligand-to-PDB ID mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs and Associated Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`cc-to-pdb.tsv`**: A tab-separated file where each line contains a ligand ID and the list of PDB IDs that contain it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Steps in the Coding Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Construct and execute attribute queries** for each input ligand to identify PDB entries where it occurs.\n",
    "2. **Collect the results**, converting them to sets of unique PDB IDs.\n",
    "3. **Write the mapping to a TSV file**, with each row formatted as `<ccid>    <pdb_id1> <pdb_id2> ...`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which PDB entries contain a specific ligand of interest?\n",
    "* How can I programmatically retrieve ligand-to-PDB mappings using the RCSB API?\n",
    "* How can this mapping support further structural or biochemical analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this notebook, users will learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the `rcsb-api` Python package to query chemical component metadata.\n",
    "* Automate batch retrieval of PDB associations for a list of ligands.\n",
    "* Write structured results to a simple, readable TSV file for further use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook supports ligand-centric analysis of PDB structures by enabling fast, automated construction of ligand-to-PDB mappings. It can serve as a foundational step for workflows in structural bioinformatics, drug discovery, and chemical component tracking across the PDB archive."
