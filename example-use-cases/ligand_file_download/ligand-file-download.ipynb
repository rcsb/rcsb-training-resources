    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to download, clean, and aggregate mmCIF data for specific ligands found in PDB structures. Using a ligand-to-PDB mapping file as input, it retrieves ligand-specific mmCIF categories (like `chem_comp` and `atom_site`) from the RCSB model server, filters out irrelevant data, and exports a combined cleaned mmCIF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs and Associated Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`input_file_path`**: Path to a TSV file mapping chemical component IDs (ligands) to associated PDB IDs.\n",
    "* **`MarshalUtil`**: Utility class from the `rcsb.utils.io` package for downloading, parsing, and writing mmCIF data.\n",
    "* **`output_file_path`**: Path to the output cleaned mmCIF file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs and Associated Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`all_cleaned_ligands.cif`**: A merged mmCIF file containing only relevant ligand data categories (`chem_comp` and `atom_site`) for all ligand–PDB pairs in the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major Steps in the Coding Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download mmCIF data** for each ligand in each specified PDB entry using `MarshalUtil`.\n",
    "2. **Filter data categories** to keep only those relevant to chemical components and atomic sites.\n",
    "3. **Merge all cleaned ligand data** into a single mmCIF file for downstream analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How can I efficiently retrieve ligand-specific mmCIF data from the RCSB model server?\n",
    "* How do I clean mmCIF data to keep only relevant chemical and atomic site information?\n",
    "* How can I aggregate ligand data across multiple PDB entries into a single file?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this notebook, users will learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `MarshalUtil` to import and export mmCIF data programmatically.\n",
    "* Filter mmCIF data containers to retain only specific categories.\n",
    "* Automate batch processing of ligand data across multiple PDB entries.\n",
    "* Post-process mmCIF files to meet formatting requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to facilitate ligand-centric mmCIF data retrieval and cleaning, supporting structural biology studies, ligand-focused data curation, or preparation of datasets for computational modeling and analysis."
